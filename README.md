Hi, this is an account of [controltheplant](https://github.com/controltheplant) project. This project develops code for industrial control systems based on the IEC-61131 standard. Code published here is written on SCL and ST languages for TIA Portal and Codesys IDEs, unless otherwise specified. However, repositories in this account don't support Git :laughing:, lol, because Git for Codesys is paid and I don't want to pay for it. So source code in repositories is edited manually: 
1. Pull source files to your computer.
2. Copy the content of each source file to your IDE.
3. Copy the changes you made to source file and save it.
4. Commit changes to remote repository.

> [!WARNING]
> Never run code published here on real equipment without complete offline testing in simulated environment! All responsibility for safety remains with you.
